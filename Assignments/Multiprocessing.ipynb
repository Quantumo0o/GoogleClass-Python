    "#### Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "##### Ans\n",
    "Multiprocessing is a Python module that enables the creation of processes that can run in parallel on a computer's CPU. By allowing multiple processes to run concurrently, multiprocessing can improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks in Python programs. Multiprocessing is useful for speeding up calculations, processing large amounts of data, and performing other computationally intensive tasks."

    "#### Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "##### Ans.\n",
    "Multiprocessing and multithreading are both ways to achieve parallelism in Python, but they differ in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Memory usage: In multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space, while in multithreading, all threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Communication: In multiprocessing, processes communicate via IPC mechanisms such as pipes and queues, while in multithreading, threads communicate via shared memory and locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overhead: Multiprocessing has a higher overhead due to process creation, while multithreading has a lower overhead due to thread creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability: Multiprocessing can offer better scalability on multi-core CPUs, while multithreading has limited scalability on multi-core CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Resource use: Processes use more system resources (CPU, memory) than threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Error handling: Processes are isolated, so one process crashing does not affect others, while threads can affect each other if not properly synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks where parallelism is needed, while multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks where parallelism is needed."
